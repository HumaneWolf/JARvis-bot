# JARvis

This is a simple Discord bot to add utilities to for a private Discord server. Right now, that primarily means counting things (being a "pun jar").


## Running the bot

This bot is made with Python 3.8, using Poetry for dependency management.

* Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
* Install dependencies, using `poetry install`
* Run the bot itself.
